#### Description
Capitalist core economics, through its networks of state, legal, academic, commercial, and media institutions, has made us treat "The Economy" as if it were a fixed, natural object. This session challenges that economic realism, showing that economies have always been made and have always been societal self-expressions. In a conversational format, the Economic Media Lab will introduce its core ideas and invite participants to collectively map questions and desires toward the making of economies in a pluri-nodal, pluri-local, pluri-practical, and popular endeavour.

#### Long description
Through the work of its agentive assemblage of state, legal, academic, commercial and media institutions, capitalist core economics has achieved to habitualise an idea of "The Economy" as a thing to be approached ‒ studied, viewed, understood, reacted to ‒ in the same way as natural objects. This idea of an "Economic Realism" ‒ not seldom mobilised with condescension toward other-than-capitalist economic ideation ‒ grew as much from structuralist-objectivist desires in late 19th century theory, the Friedman doctrine of the distinct existences of economic and social domains, and the political ascent of capitalist alternativelessness seeded in the Reagan/Thatcher era and since swallowed resistanceless and whole by the "Genossen der Bosse" (comrades of the bosses) into which former social-democratic politics have transformed post-1989.

The "invisible hand" of the market and the market dictate inferred from it ‒ or, "economic realities" ‒ to which this idea likes to allude, cannot work without the absolute insistence that there is nothing cultural about economies, i.e., that they never were, nor ever could be made. 

This is, of course, not true.

Economies have always been made ‒ they have always been societal self-expressions. And they not only can, but continue always to be made. Today's capitalist "pressures" ‒ as if a physical force ‒ are but social consensus with, or at least social acceptance of the actuality of one specific self-composed and -engineered self-setting.

The idea that economics is incomprehensible to all but "specialists" educated in the select excellence centres at the core of the capitalist core, and irresponsive, inaccessible to shaping desires, is a political fiction further riveted down by every machine simulation, "official" diagram, and big data-based study. It is also fucking hilarious. 

The realism of The Economy is like the realism of living in a fantasy novel: taking for real what one just spoke into existence.

The problem, of course, is that fictions mobilise; and the capitalist fiction is by now mobilised in the galactic number of components that are accounting languages, asset holdings and conceptual metaphors by which we organise co-operation ‒ even the most resistance-desiring among us are drenched and marinated in it since we were born. Patterns and logics of capitalist (e)valuation direct us at a somatic niveau and have become reflexes.

There is many a thing to do to get out of and past the inertiated economic imagination in which we have come to be existed, and the Economic Media Lab seeks to give what it can to provide for this path. This session will take a conversational entry to talking about some of the Lab's basic ideas, and collectively mapping questions and desires toward the making of economies in a pluri-nodal, pluri-local, pluri-practical, and popular endeavour.
