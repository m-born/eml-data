- **Website** — If you see this, our new website is up and well. We will be pushing contents and squat bugs in the coming weeks. Permit please that during this period you may still encounter bugs, dead links and similar, hopefully minor nuisances. If anything major seems to be broken, please mail us at economicmedialab@proton.me. [2026-01-05]
