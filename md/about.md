# About
The Economic Media Lab promotes the actualisation of postcapital network economies.

We are a community endeavour curating, developing and producing [activities](activities.md) that promote other economic literacy at a popular level, support creative experimentation and technical development, and inform policy. Additionally, the Lab consults in economic design work.

We maintain the [EML Library](library.md), and endeavour to provision [infrastructure components](-a-provisioning.md) that support the forming of a commons of other-economic knowledge and practice.

We work to base all our operations based on a privacy-respecting, preferably FLOSS [software stack](software-stack.html).
