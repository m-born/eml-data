#### Description
Economies are media ‒ both in the McLuhanian sense of "that which organises society" and the artistic sense of "that which we form." The workshop approaches this diagnosis in a concrete and creative way: What does it mean to design economies in practice?

In this workshop, we will explore the structures and constructions of economies from a design perspective, and use our ideas, wishes and questions as tools to sketch out directions for a popular engagement with and towards other economies.
